    title: 'Decentralized Solar-Photovoltaic Generation & Thermal Load Inversion in Secondary School Laboratories in Southern Ghana',
    subtitle: 'An Empirical Case Study on Energy Resilience, Laboratory Autonomy, and Cost Amortization in East Legon Secondary Campuses',
    abstract: 'Secondary school science and ICT laboratories in the Greater Accra Region face persistent operational disruptions due to grid phase imbalances and peak tariff spikes. This empirical study documents the deployment and telemetry of a 24kW hybrid rooftop photovoltaic-inverter micro-array at Kingdom Royal Institute over a 9-month academic cycle. We analyze diurnal power generation, battery depth-of-discharge under peak physics and chemistry lab loads, and financial amortization under the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) institutional tariff structure. Findings reveal an 82.4% reduction in diesel generator reliance, stable voltage regulation for sensitive digital oscilloscopes and spectrophotometers, and an annualized cost-saving of GH₵ 48,200, demonstrating a replicable model for public and private Ghanaian second-cycle institutions.',

        heading: '1. Introduction & Problem Statement',
        content: `Secondary scientific education in tropical urban centers requires dependable electrical power. In Ghana, frequent phase volatility and intermittent outages disrupt experimental laboratory sessions—specifically electrolytic synthesis, computerized data acquisition, and microbial incubator maintenance. At Kingdom Royal Institute, prior reliance on fossil-fuel diesel backup incurred prohibitive operational costs exceeding GH₵ 5,800 monthly in diesel fuel alone, alongside acoustic and carbon emissions immediately adjacent to classroom blocks. This research investigated the efficacy of transitioning to a decentralized rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) array coupled with lithium-iron-phosphate (LiFePO4) storage to guarantee 100% lab continuity during daylight instructional hours.`,
      },
      {
        heading: '2. System Architecture & Methodology',
        content: `The micro-grid consists of forty-eight (48) 500W monocrystalline tier-1 PV modules roof-mounted on the Science and ICT Complex with a 15-degree tilt southward to optimize the local solar irradiation window (5.2 kWh/m²/day in Accra). The DC harvest feeds two 12kW split-phase hybrid pure sine-wave inverters connected to a 30kWh lithium-iron-phosphate battery bank. High-precision IoT smart energy meters were installed at the sub-distribution panels of the Chemistry, Physics, Biology, and Advanced Computing laboratories. Data was polled at 60-second intervals recording irradiance (W/m²), AC output voltage, battery state-of-charge (SOC), ambient cell temperature, and aggregate kilowatt-hour consumption across three academic terms.`,

      {
        heading: '3. Empirical Results & Load Inversion Curves',
        content: `During peak sunshine hours (10:30 AM to 2:45 PM), concurrent with scheduled laboratory sessions, the solar array consistently delivered between 18.2 kW and 22.8 kW. This output comfortably exceeded the baseline academic load of 14.6 kW (which accounts for thirty dual-core computing terminals, six fume hoods, analytical balances, and laboratory illumination). Excess generation was automatically routed to charge the battery bank to 100% SOC by 1:15 PM daily. Across the 180 monitored school instructional days, grid outages occurred on 38 occasions; in 100% of these events, the inverter system achieved zero-second transfer, preserving running experiments and delicate digital sensors without reboot or data loss.`,
      },
      {
        heading: '4. Economic Amortization & Carbon Reduction',
        content: `The gross capital expenditure (CAPEX) for the installation totaled GH₵ 185,000. Through the direct elimination of grid daylight consumption and diesel purchases, the school registered net operational savings of GH₵ 4,016 per month. Under current commercial/institutional tariff rates and accounting for 1.5% annual module degradation, the financial payback period is calculated at 3.84 years. In addition, the micro-array prevented an estimated 16.8 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions over the 9-month monitoring window, providing a tangible educational baseline for the school's Environmental Science curriculum.`,
      },
      {
        heading: '5. Conclusions & National Recommendations',
        content: `The empirical data validates that institutional rooftop solar micro-grids are not merely ecologically virtuous, but financially self-sustaining investments for Ghanaian secondary institutions. We recommend that the Ministry of Education (MoE) and the Ghana Education Service (GES) formulate a national green campus framework providing subsidized import tariffs for educational solar equipment and enabling net-metering exchange with the national grid. Student involvement in monitoring telemetry offers immense pedagogical value in real-world data science, physics, and environmental stewardship.`,
